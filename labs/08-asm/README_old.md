### Version: Atmel Studio 7

1. Create a new GCC C Executable Project for ATmega328P within `09-asm` working folder and copy/paste [template code](main.c) to your `main.c` source file.

2. In **Solution Explorer** click on the project name, then in menu **Project**, select **Add New Item... Ctrl+Shift+A** and add a new Preprocessing Assembler File (.S) `lfsr.S`. Copy/paste [template code](lfsr.S) into it.

3. In **Solution Explorer** click on the project name, then in menu **Project**, select **Add Existing Item... Shift+Alt+A** and add:
   * UART library files `uart.h`, `uart.c` from the previous lab,
   * Timer library `timer.h` from the previous labs.

### Version: Command-line toolchain

1. Copy `main.c` and `Makefile` files from previous lab to `Labs/09-asm` folder.

2. Copy/paste [template code](main.c) to your `09-asm/main.c` source file.

3. Create a new source file `lfsr.S` and copy/paste [template code](lfsr.S) into it.

4. Add the source file of UART library between the compiled files in `09-asm/Makefile`.

```Makefile
# Add or comment libraries you are using in the project
#SRCS += $(LIBRARY_DIR)/lcd.c
SRCS += $(LIBRARY_DIR)/uart.c
#SRCS += $(LIBRARY_DIR)/twi.c
#SRCS += $(LIBRARY_DIR)/gpio.c
#SRCS += $(LIBRARY_DIR)/segment.c
```

### All versions

1. Set Timer/Counter1 overflow, generate pseudo-random sequences, and transmit results via UART to PuTTY SSH Client or Serial monitor. (In SimulIDE, also display sequences using LEDs.)

2. Explore the LFSR algorithm within `rand4_asm` function. Verify which feedback taps generate a maximum length LFSR sequence for 4-structure.

   | **Taps** | **4-bit LFSR sequence**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | **Length** |
   | :-: | :-- | :-: |
   | 1, 0 |  |  |
   | 2, 0 |  |  |
   | 3, 0 |  |  |
   | 2, 1 |  |  |
   | 3, 1 | 0, 1, 3, 6, c, 8 | 6 |
   | 3, 2 |  |  |

3. See **Output Files** in Solution Explorer in Atmel Studio or use `make list` command to generate listing file `.lss` by the compiler. In this file, check: (a) interrupt vectors (How many interrupt routines are used?), (b) body of `rand4_asm` function. Is there any pseudo-instruction?

4. Use AVRÂ® Instruction Set Manual, convert one instruction from assembly to machine code, and verify your result with listing file.

5. For each instruction from `rand4_asm` function, determine the number of iterations and use the CPU cycles values to calculate the total duration of this function.

6. In the `main.c` file, program the function `uint8_t rand4_c(uint8_t value)` in C, which generates a 4-bit LFSR sequence with a maximum length. In the `.lss` file compare both functions, in assembly and your in C. What is the duration of both functions in CPU cycles?

   | **Function** | **Number of instructions** | **Total number of CPU cycles** |
   | :-- | :-: | :-: |
   | `rand4_asm` | | |
   | `rand4_c` | | |




## Part 4: Sum of the products (SoP)

1. Create a new project `09-asm_sop` and copy needed files from previous project(s).

2. In assembly, program the `uint8_t sop_asm(*uint8_t a, *uint8_t b, uint8_t length)` function to calculate the sum of the products of two integer vectors `a` and `b`, which have the same number of elements `length`. Transmit the SoP result via UART. For simplicity, consider only 8-bit sum and multiplication operations.

3. Write the same function `uint8_t sop_c(*uint8_t a, *uint8_t b, uint8_t length)` in C language and compare the duration of both functions using the file `.lss`.
